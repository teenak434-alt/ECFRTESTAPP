# UI Cleanup - Removed Question Mark Badges

## Changes Made

Successfully removed all "?" badge indicators from the UI that were appearing next to "Unknown" agency names.

### Files Modified

1. **ECFRApp_test\Views\Dashboard\Index.cshtml**
   - Removed: `<span class="badge bg-warning text-dark ms-1" title="Agency name could not be determined from API data">?</span>`
   - This badge was appearing after agency names that showed as "Unknown"

2. **ECFRApp_test\Views\DataViewer\Documents.cshtml**
   - Removed: `<span class="badge bg-warning text-dark">?</span>`
   - This badge was appearing in the Agency column for "Unknown" entries

### What Was Removed

The question mark badges were visual indicators that appeared like this:
- **Before**: `Unknown ?` (with yellow badge)
- **After**: `Unknown` (clean text)

### Files Verified (No changes needed)

- **ECFRApp_test\Views\DataViewer\Index.cshtml** - Already clean, no question marks

## Result

All UI pages now display cleaner without the "?" badges:
- ? Dashboard Index - No question marks
- ? Data Viewer Documents - No question marks  
- ? Data Viewer Index - No question marks

## Testing

After restarting the application, verify:
1. Navigate to `/Dashboard/Index` - Agency names show without "?" badges
2. Navigate to `/DataViewer/Documents` - Agency column shows "Unknown" without "?" badges
3. All tables display cleanly without warning badges

## Note

The application needs to be restarted due to previous interface changes. Once restarted, all "?" indicators will be removed from the UI.
